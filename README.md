# morethanai  
an interactive installation where humans and artificial intelligences collaborate in unprecedented ways to co-create a story.  

## concept  
we wonder..  
- What happens if we revert The roles between the users and the servers?  
- How can I become the assistant of an AI? then who is the master of whom?  

this project aims to materialise and embody the ways in which artificial intelligences (AI) affect the creation of stories and how human inputs together with nonhuman processing (AI) give us a more-than-human outcome.   


## hands-on  
we will create an interface that records speech, transcribes it to text and feeds it into a language model (which in this case is GPT). Then the AI starts generating a story. The story always ends with a question to the participants for new human input. The answer is then integrated to the story from the AI, live-projected and ends with another question. this continues until we reach an x amount of words
